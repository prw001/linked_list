LinkedList class and Node class:

LinkedList is a unidirectional list of node objects with the following methods:
private: to_end

public: append, prepend, size, head, tail, at_index, pop, contains?, find, to_s, insert_at, remove_at

Nodes are objects with a value (default to nil) and connected to the next node in the series (default to nil) or to the ‘tail’ of the list (initialized to nil).
